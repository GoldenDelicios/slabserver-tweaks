# Lightning fix

Mojang changed fires to only have a 42% chance of being put out by rain when block ticked, making lightning storms significantly more destructive to uncovered flammable buildings, especially in chunks loaded 24/7 like spawn.

Instead of building ugly glass ceilings over spawn or disabling fire tick completely, this plugin changes lightning to only set fires if it strikes netherrack or magma blocks.
