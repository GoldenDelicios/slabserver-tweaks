# Fight Club

A secret boxing ring hidden under the Monument.

* Entering the boxing ring with wool of the same color in both hands will convert the wool into powerful boxing gloves.
* Exiting the ring will remove them.
* If two or more players are in the ring and wearing gloves, they will be set to adventure mode and a fight countdown will begin.
