# Custom World Generation

Chunks generated before 1.13 used a custom preset to improve the natural terrain.

## Above ground
* Larger biomes
* Taller mountains
* Smoother rolling hills
* Sea level raised by one block for less dry rivers

## Underground
* Larger ore veins, with lower frequency for adjustment
* Larger pockets of dirt, gravel, andesite, diorite, and granite
* Pockets do not generate above sea level or below y=15, leaving only stone and ores
* Andesite, diorite, and granite generate in their own layers
  * Andesite generates near y=50
  * Diorite generates near y=35
  * Granite generates near y=20
