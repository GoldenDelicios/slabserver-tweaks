* Taller mountains
* Smoother rolling hills
* Sea level raised by one block for less dry rivers

## Underground
* Larger pockets of dirt, andesite, diorite, and granite
* Pockets do not generate above sea level or below y=21, leaving only stone, gravel, and ores
* Andesite, diorite, and granite generate in their own layers
  * Granite generates betwen layers 21-30
  * Diorite generates between layers 32-43
  * Andesite generates between layers 43-66
  * Dirt generates between layers 21-61
