# Season 3 FAQ

### When is Season 3?
We first need the full release of 1.14, and then we need PaperSpigot/essential plugins to update. This is weeks, if not months away. Once it's here, and we're ready, we'll announce the opening event.

### What happens with Season 2?
Business as usual for now, but it's a great time to tidy up builds and projects. Before we reset there will be a *huge* farewell event. Date is TBA.

### Will there be a Season 2 download?
Absolutely. We plan on having several downloads to make it easier for those with slow connections or datacaps.

### Am I too late to start playing on Season 2?
There's plenty of fun to be had in the weeks remaining of the season. Start and finish a house in that time, help tidy spawn, make new friends, there's so much for you to join in on.

### Is the Season 3 trailer the Season 3 world?
No. We're still working on finding the perfect seed, though there's a couple of easter eggs in there.

### Will all the tweaks carry over?
Closer to reset, we will be looking for feedback on what server changes should be tweaked/overhauled/removed (if any).

### Will there be new puzzles?
If only you could see the future and know what we've been working on...

### How will spawn work?
We'll have a plan for spawns layout. This is not with any intention to restrict peoples creativity, but location of the welcome booth, etho statue, town hall and shop districts will all be considered before launch.

### How will the nether hub work?
We'll plan out the design of the Nether Hub in advance. We aim to make it as modular and expandable as possible
